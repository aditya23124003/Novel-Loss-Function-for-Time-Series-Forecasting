 Developed a NOVEL LOSS FUNCTION for time-series datset.The proposed Novel Loss Function consistently outperforms standard loss functions, including Huber Loss, in tasks where recent data trends hold greater importance. Its
 dynamic weighting mechanism ensures that models focus on relevant, recent data while
 maintaining smooth and accurate predictions
